# Shopify Plugin for Medusa

This plugin uses the public product feeds from Shopify.

## Get Started

1. To get started, install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Then, publish the plugin locally:

   ```bash
   npx medusa plugin:publish
   ```

3. If you haven't already, register the plugin in your Medusa application's `medusa-config.ts`. This step is already implemented in `apps/medusa` so skip this step if you are working on `apps/medusa`:

   ```ts
   module.exports = defineConfig({
     // ...
     plugins: [
       {
         resolve: 'medusa-plugin-shopify',
         options: {
           baseUrl: process.env.SHOPIFY_BASE_URL,
         },
       },
     ],
   });
   ```

   where `SHOPIFY_BASE_URL` should point to the website domain of the Shopify storefront, e.g.

   ```plaintext
   SHOPIFY_BASE_URL=https://www.my-store.com
   ```

4. This plugin contains new models for the custom product properties that are linked to Product module's models. To reflect these new models in your database, in the root of your Medusa application (`apps/medusa`), run the ff:

   ```bash
   npx medusa db:migrate
   ```

5. If you are in development mode (i.e. making changes in apps/medusa-plugin-shopify), follow the steps in [Development mode](#development-mode) section. Otherwise, you can now run the development server of your Medusa application (`apps/medusa`):

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   Your local development server runs at http://localhost:9000 by default. Refer to [How to use the API](#how-to-use-the-api) section to start using this API for product data migration.

## Development Mode

When in development, republish the plugin every time new changes are saved:

```bash
npx medusa plugin:develop
```

Then in Medusa application, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Your local development server runs at http://localhost:9000 by default. Refer to [How to use the API](#how-to-use-the-api) section to start using this API for product data migration.

### With Admin UI Extensions

In a Medusa plugin with admin UI extensions (e.g. routes, widgets in src/admin) such as this plugin (apps/medusa-plugin-shopify), when in development mode (i.e. after running `npx medusa plugin:develop` and running local dev server in apps/medusa), the admin UI changes are not reflected in the local dev server sometimes. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/issues/12556).

As a workaround, when running this plugin in development mode, do the ff steps, assuming you have already done the steps mentioned in [Get started](#get-started) section:

1. Run the ff command to watch for changes in the plugin and automatically update the plugin in the Medusa application using it:

   ```bash
   npx medusa plugin:develop
   ```

2. In the Medusa application run the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   Your local development server runs at http://localhost:9000 by default.

3. Confirm admin UI extensions are shown in Medusa application. Then, make some changes to any of the admin UI extensions in `src/admin`.

4. If the changes are not reflected, force a file save anywhere outside `src/admin` (e.g. by pressing CTRL + S in any files in src/api) to trigger a change in the plugin and rebuilds it.

5. Refresh the Medusa application. In some cases, this will already reflect any admin UI extensions changes made in `src/admin` and all changes from now on.

6. However, if changes are still not reflected or cached content are shown or the ff error appears in the terminal:

   ```text
   [vite] error while updating dependencies ...
   ```

   Do the ff steps:
   a. Stop the Medusa application (`apps/medusa`) and the Plugin development watch mode (`apps/medusa-plugin-shopify`)
   b. In `apps/medusa`, remove the changes made to `"medusa-plugin-shopify"` in package.json.
   c. In `apps/medusa`, remove `node_modules`, `.medusa`, `.yalc`, and `yalc.lock`:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules && rm -rf .medusa && rm -rf .yalc && rm -rf yalc.lock
   ```

   d. In `apps/medusa-plugin-shopify`, remove `node_modules` and `.medusa`:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules && rm -rf .medusa
   ```

   e. Re-do steps #1 to #3 in [Get started](#get-started) section. For step #1, run the command in the monorepo root.
   f. Re-do steps #1 to #3 in [Development Mode > With Admin UI Extensions](#with-admin-ui-extensions) section.
   g. At this point, any changes to admin UI extensions in the plugin will be reflected in Medusa application. However, if issue/error still persists, we would have to rely on rebuilding the plugin every time we make some changes by repeating the Steps a to f.

## How it Works

This plugin exposes an API route (`/admin/shopify-plugin/migrate`) to migrate Shopify products, collections, tags, and types from the provided base URL. The full flow is as follows:

1. Extract all Products from Shopify
2. Extract all Product Collections from Shopify
3. Build the unique list of Product Types then import them to Medusa
4. Build the unique list of Product Tags then import them to Medusa
5. Import all Product Collections to Medusa, update existing ones if necessary
6. Import all Products to Medusa, update existing ones if necessary
7. Link Products to Product Collections

> **Note**: There is a default hard limit of 2000 Products and 2000 Product Collections to be extracted from Shopify to prevent a heap out of memory error.

### How to use the API

#### Authentication

Send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:9000/auth/user/emailpass` to get the authorization tokens, sample request body should contain the admin credentials you use for your Medusa admin dashboard:

```cURL
curl --location 'http://localhost:9000/auth/user/emailpass' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": "YOUR_EMAIL",
    "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
}'
```

The above request should give you an authorization token.

#### Migrate

Send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:9000/admin/shopify-plugin/migrate`:

```cURL
curl --location 'http://localhost:9000/admin/shopify-plugin/migrate' \
--header 'X-Publishable-API-Key: YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN' \
--data ''
```

## Custom Properties

In this plugin, I've added two new models: `product_extended` and `product_variant_extended`, which are linked to `product` and `product_variant` models respectively. These new models holds custom properties for the product. During product migration, these custom properties are already populated. To interact with the custom properties after the migration, please refer to the ff sections below:

### Creating/Updating a Product via API route

In the body of POST request to `admin/products` API route, pass the custom property in the `additional_data` object. For example, in this plugin, the custom property for product data model is `vendor`. To pass a `vendor` property when creating a new product, do the ff:

```cURL
curl -X POST 'localhost:9000/admin/products' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
--data '{
    "title": "Shoes",
    "options": [
      {
        "title": "Default option",
        "values": ["Default option value"]
      }
    ],
    "shipping_profile_id": "{shipping_profile_id}",
    "additional_data": {
        "vendor": "test"
    }
}'
```

Same concept when updating an existing product:

```cURL
curl -X POST 'localhost:9000/admin/products/{product_id}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
--data '{
    "additional_data": {
        "vendor": "test 2"
    }
}'
```

The same process can be done when creating (`/admin/products/:id/variants`) or updating (`/admin/products/:id/variants/:variant_id`) a product variant with custom properties.

### Querying with Custom Property

To retrieve the custom property when retrieving the product through API routes, pass in the `fields` query parameter `+custom_model_name.*`. For example, for the `product_extended` model, do the ff:

```cURL
curl 'localhost:9000/admin/products/{product_id}?fields=+product_extended.*' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```

Among the returned product object, you'll find a `product_extended` property which holds the details of the linked product extended record:

```JSON
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "prod_01K4D425DJ271F7N8A8268B15Y",
      "title": "Kepler Sweater",
      // ...
      "product_extended": {
        "id": "01K4D45ZEB0XF3ZDNTR0H16MQ8",
        "vendor": "tentree",
        "created_at": "2025-09-05T14:23:42.027Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-09-05T14:23:42.027Z",
        "deleted_at": null
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

To get the custom properties of the variants (`product_variant_extended`) within the product, you can do the ff:

```cURL
curl 'localhost:9000/admin/products/{product_id}?fields=+product_extended.*,+variants.product_variant_extended.*' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```

```JSON
{
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "prod_01K4D425DJ271F7N8A8268B15Y",
      "title": "Kepler Sweater",
      // ...
      "product_extended": {
        "id": "01K4D45ZEB0XF3ZDNTR0H16MQ8",
        "vendor": "tentree",
        "created_at": "2025-09-05T14:23:42.027Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-09-05T14:23:42.027Z",
        "deleted_at": null
      },
      "variants": [
        {
          "id": "variant_01K4D44JXDJ39RDJAX5V5XZXXM",
          "title": "MIDNIGHT BLUE KEPLER / S",
          // ...
          "product_variant_extended": {
            "id": "01K4D45ZFDYCDM5CB36VD2H7VW",
            "requires_shipping": true,
            "created_at": "2025-09-05T14:23:42.061Z",
            "updated_at": "2025-09-05T14:23:42.061Z",
            "deleted_at": null
          },
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

When retrieving the custom properties of a variant (`product_variant_extended`) using the product variant API route (`/admin/products/:id/variants`), do the ff:

```cURL
curl 'localhost:9000/admin/products/{product_id}/variants?fields=+product_variant_extended.*' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```

```JSON
{
  "variants": [
    {
      "id": "variant_01K4D44JXD8GMBFSFC95P8EDAJ",
      "product_id": "prod_01K4D425DJ271F7N8A8268B15Y",
      "title": "MIDNIGHT BLUE KEPLER / XL",
      // ...
      "product_variant_extended": {
          "id": "01K4D45ZG87Z6608TC5FS7RZ8G",
          "requires_shipping": true,
          "created_at": "2025-09-05T14:23:42.088Z",
          "updated_at": "2025-09-05T14:23:42.088Z",
          "deleted_at": null
      },
    }
  ]
}
```

### Showing Custom Property in Admin UI

To show the custom properties in the [Admin UI](http://localhost:9000/app), we need to utilize [Medusa Admin Widget(https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/customization/customize-admin/widget)]. We can add widgets to any of the pre-defined zones in the Product Detail Page of the Admin UI to show the Product data model's custom properties that we added.

For the product-level custom properties, a [`product-extended` widget](src/admin/widgets/product-extended.tsx) is created. For the variant-level custom properties, a [`product-variant-extended` widget](src/admin/widgets/product-variant-extended.tsx) is created.

However, there’s currently no way to customize the existing create/update product form page to add a new field that represents the custom property we added to the Product model. This means there’s currently no way for us to add a new or update the value of the custom property in the Admin UI. We can only do so using API routes.

### Filtering by Custom Property

Currently, we can't use the built-in Product API routes to filter the products by custom property. Instead, we need to create a custom API route and construct our own custom logic to support filtering by custom property.

To filter the products by product-level custom property, use the ff API route: `/admin/products-with-custom-properties`:

```cURL
curl 'localhost:9000/admin/products-with-custom-properties?vendor=test&fields=+product_extended.*' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```

To filter the product variants by variant-level custom property, use the ff API route: `/admin/product-variants-with-custom-properties`:

```cURL
curl 'localhost:9000/admin/products-variants-with-custom-properties?requires_shipping=false&fields=+product_variant_extended.*' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```
